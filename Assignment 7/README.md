Write a JAVA program that implements an Http server that handles requests for transferring files of different types (eg jpeg images, gif) 
coming from a web browser.

The server:
- Listens on a port known to the client (eg 6789);
- Handles GET type Http requests to the Request URL -localhost: port / filename

Connections can be non-persistent.

Use the Socket and ServerSocket classes to develop the server program.

To send requests to the server, use any browser.
